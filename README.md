Take a list, and write a program that prints out all the elements of the list that are less than 10.

- Divisors

[View the prompt](https://www.practicepython.org/exercise/2014/02/26/04-divisors.html)

Create a program that asks the user for a number and then prints out a list of all the divisors of that number. (If you donâ€™t know what a divisor is, it is a number that divides evenly into another number. For example, 13 is a divisor of 26 because 26 / 13 has no remainder.)

[View the prompt](https://www.practicepython.org/exercise/2014/03/05/05-list-overlap.html)

Take two lists, and write a program that returns a list that contains only the elements that are common between the lists. Make sure your program works on two lists of different sizes.

Extras: Randomly generate two lists to test this
